# NSCD

NSCD stands for Name Service Cache Daemon. It's a service commonly found on Unix-like operating systems that helps cache various name service lookups such as hostnames, user names, and group names. NSCD aims to improve system performance by caching this information and reducing the number of times the system needs to query the network or other name services like DNS or LDAP.

By caching this data, NSCD can speed up processes that require frequent lookups, making the system more responsive. However, improper configuration or issues with NSCD can sometimes lead to inconsistencies in the cached data or cause unexpected behavior in the name resolution process.
