# Zookeeper Server

Setting up a ZooKeeper server in standalone mode or in replicated mode.

A replicated group of servers in the same application is called a quorum, and in
replicated mode, all servers in the quorum have copies of the same configuration
file. The file is similar to the one used in standalone mode, but with a few
differences.
