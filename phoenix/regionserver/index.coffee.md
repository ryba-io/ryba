# Phoenix

Apache Phoenix is a relational database layer over HBase delivered as a client-embedded
JDBC driver targeting low latency queries over HBase data. Apache Phoenix takes
your SQL query, compiles it into a series of HBase scans, and orchestrates the
running of those scans to produce regular JDBC result sets.
